# PYTHON FOR FINANCE
When we think of an investment, we have to remember two things – its upside and its downside. In other words, we should consider the profit that will be made if everything goes well and the risk of losses if the investmentis unsuccessful.

The art of finance isn’t about maximizing an investor’s returns in a year. It is about making informed decisions that consider both dimensions, risk and return, and optimizing the risk-return combination of an investment portfolio.

Doing this yourself and manually can become a difficult task for any investor, as the calculations are very repetitive and complex.

## Why I chose Python

1. Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics etc).
2. User-friendly data structures.
3. Open source and community development. 
4. Ideal for prototypes – provide more functionality with less coding.
5. Portable across Operating systems.
